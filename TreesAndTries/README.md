#  TreesAndTries (and a binarySearch)
So, it behooves me to review Objective-C again.   This is a port of some Wenderlich data structures and
Algorithms Swift stuff to ObjC.   I reviewed Paul Hudson's excellent 'Objective-C for Swift programmers'
book, it's only 150 pages, and used it to write this code.

It's an AVLTree, a Trie, and a BinarySearch.   It was fun to get back into ObjC, if only for a day.
